# Rust Hashed Traits Example

This repository demonstrates how to implement hashed traits in Rust using the Blake2b algorithm, with a focus on security, flexibility, and elegance.

## Features
1. **Two Examples**:  
   - The first example is a practical implementation (`practical-example`).  
   - The second example focuses on elegance in design (`elegance-example`).
   
2. Both examples can be tested and verified by running `cargo test`, ensuring that they succeed.

3. Written entirely in Rust.

4. **Requirements**:  
   - Docker is the only dependency required to run the examples.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/u-na-gi/rust-hashed-traits-example.git
   ```

2. Build the examples using Docker:
    ```bash
    make build
    ```

3. Review the code in the `practical-example` and `elegance-example` directories to explore different approaches.
